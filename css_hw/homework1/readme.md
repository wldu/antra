Requirements

- Header
	- Stretches horizontally across the whole page.
	- 60px tall.
- Columns
	- Both the left and right columns have a fixed width of 100px.
	- The center column is fluid-width.
	- All the columns should have the same height, regardless of which column is the tallest.
- Footer
	- Stretches horizontally across the whole page.
	- 100px tall.
	- The footer should be at the bottom of the page even if there is not enough content to fill up the viewport height.
